Git

## Installation and Scripts
First, check to see if you have node.js and npm installed. Run: 

```bash
node -v
```

If you have node installed, you'll see a version number (e.g., v22.13.0). If node is not installed, you need to download it. --> [Download nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Check your npm version by running the following command:

```bash
npm -v
```

It will also give you a version number (e.g., v10.9.2). Npm comes bundled with node, so you don't need to install npm separately.

Next, install Angular. Run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Create a new Angular project with the following command:

```bash
npm new my-angular-app
```

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd my-angular-app
```

To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng g c component-name
```

This will generate the necessary files for your component.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

To exit your server, press Ctrl + C
